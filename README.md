# MBTA-API-OA

## Story Form
As an MBTA rider, I would like to know when the next train is going to depart from a specific
stop so that I know when I should plan to get to the boarding area.

## Project Instructions
1. Your program should prompt users to select from a list of routes that service only Light
and Heavy Rail trains.
2. Your program should display a listing of stops related to the selected route and prompt
the user to select a stop
3. Your program should display a list of route directions and prompt the user to select a
direction
4. Your program should display the next predicted departure time for a train based on the
previously selected inputs

## Run this project:
- npm i (to install all the dependencies)
- ng s --o (automatically open the application in a browser)
